TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol used for reliable data transfer over the internet. It ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and that any errors are detected and corrected.
SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol): SSDP is a protocol used for discovering devices on a network. It allows devices to advertise their presence and capabilities to other devices on the network.
DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a protocol used for translating domain names into IP addresses. It allows users to access websites and other online resources using easy-to-remember domain names instead of IP addresses.
